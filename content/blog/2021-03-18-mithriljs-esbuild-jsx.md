# Mithril.js + esbuild + JSX

**EDIT 7/18/2022:** esbuild has since added support for [string literals as JSX fragments](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1217), meaning much of what I wrote below is now unnecessary. To use JSX with Mithril and esbuild, all you need to do is set `jsxFragment: '"["'` in your esbuild config. See [here](https://github.com/kevinfiol/newt/blob/master/scripts/bundle.js) for an example.

I recently bootstrapped a [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org) project using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for my bundling purposes. If you don't already know, esbuild is a next-gen bundler written in Go by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw) that is magnitudes faster than rollup, webpack, or parcel (all of which are written in JS/TS).

esbuild comes with JSX support out of the box. While I don't normally use JSX, I decided to create a demo for [mithril.netlify.app](https://mithril.netlify.app) showing off that JSX works just fine in a Mithril application. However, I ran into one major issue -- esbuild wasn't compiling JSX fragments correctly when providing `m.fragment` as the JSX fragment pragma. 

After some digging around, I found [this comment](https://gitter.im/mithriljs/mithril.js?at=5b98ce1c51a02e2a261ac656) by [Claudia Meadows](https://github.com/isiahmeadows).

In short, there's no support for Mithril fragments as Components currently. esbuild (as well as transpilers like Sucrase) compiles JSX using the provided jsx pragma + jsx fragment method in the form of:

```js
React.createElement(React.Fragment, null, "Stuff");
```

See [here](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#jsx-fragment) for more details.

Which in Mithril's case, can't work with `m.fragment`. Following Claudia's advice, defining a simple Fragment component as so worked for me. I just put this in my `index.js` file near the top:
```js
m.Fragment = { view: vnode => vnode.children };
```
Then I just set `jsxFragment` to `m.Fragment` instead of `m.fragment` in my esbuild config and voil√†! Fragments work as you'd expect.

```js
var JSX = {
  view: function() {
    return (
      <>
        <h2>JSX</h2>
        <p>You could use JSX with Mithril.js as well.</p>
        <p>Be aware that this requires a build-step.</p>
        <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>
            Attributes work as expected.
        </p>
        <p>This application uses <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> to convert JSX.</p>
      </>
    );
  }
};
```

For reference, you can see my full esbuild config and my bundle scripts [here](https://github.com/kevinfiol/mithril-pres/tree/master/scripts). Direct any questions to [me@kevinfiol.com](mailto:me@kevinfiol.com) and I'd be happy to answer them.
