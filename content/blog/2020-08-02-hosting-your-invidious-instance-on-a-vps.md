# Hosting Your Invidious Instance on a VPS

**Update 2022: This post is likely outdated. I recommend checking the official installation instructions found on the [Github repo](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious).**

[Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) is an alternative front-end to YouTube with an emphasis on privacy and low system resource usage. It is wonderful free software that not only does away with the annoyances of Google's bloated, ad-ridden video site, but also adds plenty of QoL features.

This weekend I spent some time setting up my own instance of Invidious to share with friends. Here's a quick rundown on what I did:

## 1. Pick a server

I went with the $5/mo Nanode over at [Linode](https://linode.com). It's packing a grand total 1GB of RAM, a single CPU, and 25GB of storage. More than enough to run our instance, but not enough to actually compile the damn codebase (we'll get to this in a bit).

## 2. Get a domain (or not)

I wanted a simple and short domain name for myself and my buddies to be able to use instead of typing an IP address in the address bar every time. Getting a domain isn't terribly important especially if you're hosting this just for your own use.

For the record, I used Namecheap to purchase my domain. I found [this guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803032836/https://merelycurious.me/post/connecting-namecheap-domain-to-linode) particularly helpful in setting up my domain with my Linode VPS.

## 3. Pick a Linux Distribution for your VPS

Again, not terribly important what you pick. If you plan to use [Invidious Updater](https://github.com/tmiland/Invidious-Updater), know that it only supports Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Arch. Originally I attempted to use it on an Alpine Linux installation, but the script promptly failed.

Also, the Invidious docs only provide installation instructions for Arch Linux and Debian/Ubuntu. I went with **Arch Linux**.

## 4. Pick how you're going to install Invidious

The [README](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/blob/master/README.md) provides 3 options:

* Install Invidious manually
* Use Invidious Updater (linked above)
* Use Docker

All options are simple and easy to do. I went with **1**.

## 5. Install it!

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu base-devel shards crystal librsvg postgresql nano
```

Create Invidious user:
```bash
useradd -m invidious
sudo -i -u invidious
git clone https://github.com/iv-org/invidious
exit
```

Setup Postgres:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo -i -u postgres
psql -c "CREATE USER kemal WITH PASSWORD 'kemal';" # Change 'kemal' here to a stronger password, and update `password` in config/config.yml
createdb -O kemal invidious
psql invidious kemal < /home
exit
```

I was only able to run the following commands as root. Make sure the postgresql service is running:
```bash
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/channels.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/videos.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/channel_videos.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/users.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/session_ids.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/nonces.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/annotations.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/playlists.sql
psql invidious kemal < /home/invidious/invidious/config/sql/playlist_videos.sql
```

The next steps to install Invidious involve compiling the project code. On my measly 1GB of RAM, the compilation choked. In order to prepare for this, I used `systemd-swap` to create a swapfile. There are other ways to create a swapfile or a swap partition on Linux. See: [Swap on Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Swap). I found using `systemd-swap` the simplest. [This guide by Ricosta Cruz](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803033711/https://ricostacruz.com/til/after-installing-arch-linux) was very helpful.

I did as follows:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu systemd-swap
```

Then I edited the config file to enable `zram_enabled=1` and `swapfc_enabled=1`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/swap.conf
```

Then enable `systemd-swap.service`:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-swap
```

Finally add the swapfile to `/etc/fstab` so it'll be used on every boot. Add this: `/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0` to the end of the file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Finally, you won't run out of RAM to setup Invidious. Let's go back and finally install it:
```bash
sudo -i -u invidious
cd invidious
shards update && shards install
crystal build src/invidious.cr --release
./invidious # test compiled binary, stop with ctrl c
exit
```

It's installed! Now some administrative stuff. Let's setup the systemd service so that Invidious runs in the background:
```bash
sudo cp /home/invidious/invidious/invidious.service /etc/systemd/system/invidious.service
sudo systemctl enable invidious.service
sudo systemctl start invidious.service
```

And lets rotate the logs so that they don't balloon in size:
```bash
sudo echo "/home/invidious/invidious/invidious.log {
rotate 4
weekly
notifempty
missingok
compress
minsize 1048576
}" | tee /etc/logrotate.d/invidious.logrotate

sudo chmod 0644 /etc/logrotate.d/invidious.logrotate
```

You now got a running Invidious instance! Navigate to your VPS's IP address on port 3000 to see it up and running. Type `http://<VPS_IP_ADDRESS>:3000` into your browser's address bar, and get to watching some videos!

## 6. (Optional) Setting up nginx

When I bought my domain, I intended to use it for more than just Invidious. In my case, I wanted a subdomain to serve as my Invidious URL, while I can use the main domain to host a "hub" of sorts to other services.

So for example:
```bash
http://tube.mydomain.com -> Invidious Service
http://mydomain.com -> Homepage
```

I was able to do this easily using nginx reverse proxies. Here are the steps I took.

Install nginx:
```bash
pacman -Syu nginx-mainline
```

Enable and start nginx service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx.service
sudo systemctl start nginx.service
```

Configure `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Add this additional `server` entry somewhere under `http`:
```bash
http {
  ...

  server {
    server_name tube.mydomain.com;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    }
  }
  
  ...
}
```

Next addition is completely optional if you want your root domain to point to a kind of homepage. This is what I wanted, so I'm putting it here partly to document it for myself. I changed the existing, default `http.server` entry to point to custom `html` I had written:
```bash
http {
  server {
    server_name mydomain.com

    location / {
      root /sites/mydomain.com
      index index.html index.htm
    }

    ... # the rest remained unchanged from the default
  }
  
  ...
}
```

## 7. (Optional) Enabling HTTPS

I used [EFF's Certbot for this](https://certbot.eff.org/). It is painfully easy to use. Note that if you choose to, it *will* make modifications to your `nginx.conf` for you.

You must enable an option in Invidious's config if you want assets to only be transferred via HTTPS. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/wiki/Configuration).
