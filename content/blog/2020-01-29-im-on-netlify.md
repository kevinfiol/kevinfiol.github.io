# I'm on Netlify

First of all, happy birthday to my big bro! He's 29 today. Wishing him good fortune, good health, good food, etc.

On topic: I had been using Github Pages as my homepage solution for years now. Six years to be exact, which means since I was a senior finishing my undergrad. One of the reasons I began using it was that it was one of the only (if not, most popular) freely available static-site hosting solutions, and incredibly developer friendly. The same cannot be said in the year 2020.

Update: As of May 2021, I am back to Github Pages, being deployed via Github Actions. My reasoning for switching back was some inherent latency I discovered while using pages deployed on Netlify. Github Pages is snappier, in my experience.
