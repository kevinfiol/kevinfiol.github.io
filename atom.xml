&lt;p&gt;2025 was my first full year as a married man, and I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the &quot;settled down&quot; life. Nevertheless, here are some things I did this past year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-did-in-2025&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-did-in-2025&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-did-in-2025&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I did in 2025&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Held a belated wedding reception&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Although I got married in 2024, my wife and I did not have a wedding reception in 2024, only a small ceremony in my mother-in-law&#x27;s house with immediate family. In January 2025, we had a reception with extended family and friends at a local park. While renting the park&#x27;s indoor ballroom would have been at least $1000, renting the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;115827249131915984&quot;&gt;outdoor patio&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the entire evening was only $150, so we chose that option and scheduled the event for January in anticipation of cool weather. We decorated the day of, and brought Cuban food to be served potluck style. We were lucky enough that the weather was perfect. In the end, we were both very happy with the outcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saw the Grand Canyon, Zion, Valley of Fire, Lake Powell, Antelope Canyon, and other things.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; For our honeymoon, we flew to Las Vegas, rented a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;114322577270618425&quot;&gt;campervan&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and drove around Nevada, Utah, and Arizona for a little under 2 weeks as we hiked, camped at, and explored several national and state parks. We made plenty of stops along the way whenever we saw scenic places to stop. We also took about a day in Las Vegas to check out the pinball museum, and eat some seriously good &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;114362521207804659&quot;&gt;Chinese food&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Of all of our stops, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;114294325153566217&quot;&gt;Zion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was my favorite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installed new blinds in the house&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The office in particular had some awful old blinds that would let in way too much sun. I replaced them with cellular blinds from Home Depot. We ended up liking them so much, we bought the same blinds to replace the busted up blackout curtain in the master bedroom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did a rock-climbing course&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Last year, my wife bought us passes to ProjectROCK to help me conquer my fear of heights. After a lengthy introduction to belaying, we belayed for several hours. It was physically demanding and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m in the best shape to rock climb, but we had a ton of fun and ended the night with some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113985618684957597&quot;&gt;Thai food&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got a new job&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Probably the biggest change of 2025 came with my new employment. In March 2025, I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skylight.digital&quot;&gt;Skylight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to work on a project for the CDC, which I had the privilege of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;114262992758074301&quot;&gt;visiting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Atlanta. I&#x27;m blessed to still have a career in government contracting, and to work among intelligent and inspirational people at Skylight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got an old Sony Trinitron for my &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113827181030129306&quot;&gt;retro CRT station&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Along with getting a SummerCart64, I now have a dedicated little nook for CRT gaming in the office using an old CRT my uncle was throwing out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;114186632926639985&quot;&gt;Renaissance Fair&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This was a first for me after many years of wondering what they were like. We saw jousting, a catapult demonstration, sword fighting, jester performances, and fire juggling. Food-wise, nothing impressive, but definitely a fun atmosphere to attend with friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started practicing guitar again&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For years I found a comfort zone on guitar where I would play chords or patterns I&#x27;ve learned from songs, or just noodle until I heard something pretty. This year, after many months of failing to stick to a self-learning regimen, I hired a guitar instructor from Argentina to give me lessons on lead blues guitar and some basic theory. Within a few weeks, I felt like I already made tremendous progress, and I&#x27;m excited to continue into 2026.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joined a run club and ran a 10K&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In early 2025, my wife found a local run club that meets at a park within walking distance of our house. The short walk made it hard to cheat going, so we began attending regularly to run 5Ks on each meet. After a few runs, I started to get addicted, and now I am a happy participant. I also enjoy the community that has formed around the club. In November, some club members informed us of a 10K, and after training for a couple of weeks, my wife and I successfully ran &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;115574883843580588&quot;&gt;our first 10K&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scored some retro goodies from Japan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is less something I did and more received -- but my father traveled to Japan this year, and brought several of my favorite games he found in bargain bins at used book shops. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;115595435011705701&quot;&gt;This made me feel like a kid again&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laid new pavers in the backyard&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As part of our ongoing project to revitalize our backyard, we found a contractor through a family friend who helped remove a large slab of concrete where an old extension to the house used to stand. We replaced it using a combination of reused pavers and newly bought ones. While we were not completely happy with the job, it came at a significant discount, and overall, it&#x27;s a major improvement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep-dived into SQLite&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In 2024, I used continuing education funds to purchase an online course on SQLite. In 2025, I went through the whole course while applying its lessons to a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;sqlite-bench&quot;&gt;SvelteKit application&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (which gave me a solid opportunity to learn a bit of SvelteKit!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switched my personal PC to Linux&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. While I&#x27;ve used Linux-based operating systems on my work machines for years, I never made the switch on my personal PC due to my love of video games. In 2025, after much encouragement from some friends, I made the jump from Windows 10 LTSC to Fedora KDE and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The transition has been overall smooth, and software development on my personal PC is finally a joy after years of fighting Windows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built a mini homelab&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I&#x27;ve been using Raspberry Pis to self-host a myriad of applications on my local network, but they&#x27;ve always been scattered about on a shelf, and I never organized my setup scripts for them. Inspired by the &quot;minirack&quot; movement, but too cheap to commit to all of the parts and materials, I repurposed a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;harvmatta-letter-tray-anthracite-20578585&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HARVMATTA letter tray from IKEA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by flipping all of the trays upside down and using magnets to attach my Pis, storage, network switch, and power. The result is what I call the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;116015494838265604&quot;&gt;poor man&#x27;s minirack&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. As for the software running on my minirack:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immich for myself and my wife to backup and view our photo collections&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jellyfin Media Server that lets me listen to my music library from anywhere&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paperless-ngx for document management and OCR&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenMediaVault as a general-use NAS&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copyparty as a general-use file server&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-programmed-in-2025&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-programmed-in-2025&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-programmed-in-2025&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I programmed in 2025&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 was not an eventful year in terms of starting new open-source projects, but there are a few developments I could mention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as my primary Git forge in 2025. This is something I had dragged my feet on for a while considering Github&#x27;s popularity and the network effects. I still use Github for work and all of my NPM packages still remain on Github. Going forward, however, I intend to upload solo projects exclusively to Codeberg. My reasoning for this is Github&#x27;s constant feature creep and performance issues, not to mention Microsoft&#x27;s ownership of the platform, and hostility toward open-source.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a bootable image of Alpine Linux for the RK3566 chip and RG-Arc handhelds. While I have yet to clean up the repository for Codeberg, I hope to polish this and upload it in 2026.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;arkive&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;arkive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - I got arkive to an MVP level I was comfortable with, and even hosted it on my personal server for private use. However, I eventually discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sissbruecker&#x2F;linkding&quot;&gt;linkding&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which was already miles ahead of arkive in feature set, simple to host, and performant &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I may return to developing arkive, but in the meantime, I&#x27;ve been happy with linkding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;beancms&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;beancms&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - I built a micro-CMS using Redbean. This is a single-file web application with multiple user support for simple, lightweight, Markdown-based blogging. In 2025, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;a-tour-of-beancms&#x2F;&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about its features and expanded on the reasons for its existence. It was well-received by the Redbean community, and even got starred on Github by Justine Tunney, creator of Redbean -- which made me happy. :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;quilt&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;quilt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - I wanted a quick way to create a fullscreen, tiled, slideshow similar to the iTunes Album Art screensavers of old. This was a quick and dirty attempt again using Redbean.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;braindump&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;braindump&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - A work-in-progress I hope to resume development on again soon. The idea behind &lt;code&gt;braindump&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; was using Redbean to create &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; single-file web application. This time, I am hoping to create something of a minimal Obsidian-alternative for &quot;digital garden&quot; style notebooks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;utils&#x2F;src&#x2F;branch&#x2F;main&#x2F;sqlite&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;utils&#x2F;src&#x2F;branch&#x2F;main&#x2F;sqlite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - A work-in-progress wrapper for &lt;code&gt;node:sqlite&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@lukeed&#x2F;hrana&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to unify the API for interacting with local SQLite files, and remote Turso (Hrana API) databases. The code that is here is quite outdated, partly because I&#x27;ve been working on...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A personal issue tracker&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; - A couple years ago, I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribe.rip&#x2F;@01010111&#x2F;managing-your-home-using-github-266d7258eb9a&quot;&gt;this article by Will Blanton&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about using Github Issues to organize personal chores. The idea worked pretty well for myself using Gitea issues, but after a while of doing this, I felt the idea could be improved with a dedicated application, backed by SQLite. Currently, the repo is set to private since I&#x27;m also using this project as a learning opportunity for my cousin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-did-not-do-in-2025&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-did-not-do-in-2025&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-did-not-do-in-2025&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I did NOT do in 2025&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I said I planned to do in 2025 that I did not get around to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install an irrigation system and place new sod in the backyard&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Unfortunately, the landscaping work we had planned for our backyard had to be put off until we had finished installing the pavers for our new patio. Now that that work has been completed, I hope to have this done in 2026.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep-dive into Postgres&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I put this off in favor of doing a deep-dive into SQLite. I&#x27;m content exploring SQLite for much of 2026 as well since it fits my needs for the moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get back into gamedev&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is the one that hurts the most. Game development has been the single most difficult study wishlist item for me to stick to. I intend to try to focus on a single tool (Godot) in 2026 to help me make progress on this, and may even spend some money on video courses with my tech budget allowance from work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-plan-to-do-in-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-plan-to-do-in-2026&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-plan-to-do-in-2026&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I plan to do in 2026&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Travel to Spain.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; My wife and I are planning to travel to Spain in May-June. My wife has wanted to see a Spanish-speaking country for several years, and I suggested Spain as a great place to start. The last time I had been to Spain was 2018, so it would be nice to revisit. I also have a few cousins who live in Barcelona, and it would be nice to catch up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get back into gamedev.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; As mentioned earlier, I hope 2026 is the year I finally get comfortable with game development as a hobby.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Install irrigation system and place new sod&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As mentioned earlier, I hope 2026 is the year we can build the front&#x2F;backyards of our dreams.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Switch all of my servers&#x2F;machines to NixOS&#x2F;home-manager&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Although Nix is quite daunting to learn, the appeal of having one solution for a reproducible system&#x2F;home folder and being able to track it with version control is appealing. This will also let me move away from my collection of messy Dockerfiles&#x2F;compose files.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/deno-lsp-in-sublime-text-4/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;deno-lsp-in-sublime-text-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#deno-lsp-in-sublime-text-4&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: deno-lsp-in-sublime-text-4&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Deno LSP in Sublime Text 4&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deno.com&quot;&gt;Deno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with Sublime Text 4 can be surprisingly tricky. At the time of this writing, the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsp.sublimetext.io&quot;&gt;SublimeLSP Docs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; still recommend using the &lt;code&gt;LSP-Deno&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; package on packagecontrol.io. Unfortunately, the package is outdated, with its last update being before the release of Deno 2.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deno&#x27;s official docs include a section about using Deno LSP with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.deno.com&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;getting_started&#x2F;setup_your_environment&#x2F;#sublime-text&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The catch is it tries to encompass Sublime Text 3 and 4, and suggests using third-party &lt;code&gt;.sublime-syntax&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files to enable the language server. This is unneeded in Sublime Text 4, which already includes syntax definitions for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you&#x27;re on Sublime Text 4, you can simply add this entry to your &lt;code&gt;LSP.sublime-settings&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; Settings in here override those in &amp;quot;LSP&#x2F;LSP.sublime-settings&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;clients&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: {

        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-tour-of-beancms/"/>
        <id>https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-tour-of-beancms/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-tour-of-beancms/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-tour-of-beancms&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-tour-of-beancms&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-tour-of-beancms&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A Tour of BeanCMS&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;beancms&quot;&gt;BeanCMS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a minimalist content management system. I built it as a personal replacement for the great &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;schollz&#x2F;rwtxt&quot;&gt;rwtxt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The motivation to build BeanCMS was:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to self-host rwtxt, but had some changes I wanted to make to the core application.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted an excuse to build something using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redbean.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;redbean.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pkulchenko&#x2F;fullmoon&quot;&gt;fullmoon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; while demonstrating that Redbean and Lua are viable options for building web applications&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of using redbean, BeanCMS is deployed as a single &amp;gt;7MB file that runs natively on Windows&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Linux -- all without cross-compilation! Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;beancms&quot;&gt;repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for installation instructions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-up-and-running&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#getting-up-and-running&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: getting-up-and-running&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Getting up and running&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, download &lt;code&gt;beancms.com&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;beancms&#x2F;releases&quot;&gt;releases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page. On Linux&#x2F;MacOS, &lt;code&gt;chmod +x beancms.com&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then, on Windows&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;MacOS, simply run the file while using the current directory to store persisted data:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;.&#x2F;beancms.com -D&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; .&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: On some Linux systems with Wine installed you might run into some issues running &lt;code&gt;beancms.com&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redbean.dev&#x2F;#linux&quot;&gt;redbean.dev&#x2F;#linux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, you&#x27;ll notice a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; directory created next to your executable. This is where all persisted data for BeanCMS is stored. BeanCMS uses SQLite as supported by Redbean, which means to back up your site data, all you have to do is copy the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;user-attachments&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;18ed9c08-6e1e-456b-89b4-4421aa34c2c4&quot; alt=&quot;files screenshot&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon opening the site at &lt;code&gt;localhost:8080&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, you&#x27;ll see the welcome page. From here, new users can register, or existing users can log in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;user-attachments&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;a21b2e28-971c-40a1-9d60-8784160ab11f&quot; alt=&quot;welcome page&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-page&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#user-page&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: user-page&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;User Page&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon logging in, users are able to customize their profile pages by modifying their personal title, filling in an intro section, selecting from multiple free&#x2F;open-source themes, or adding their own custom CSS that will apply to their profile page as well as their writings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;193b7f3c-75a0-4ac4-9050-f8948b5b3ced&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-posts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#writing-posts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: writing-posts&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Writing posts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posts slugs are generated automatically by parsing the first line of the post content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;d54de71d-63ac-42b9-9c55-2ed0feeb8d4f&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts are saved automatically on users&#x27; local machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;43fa99de-e048-4335-802f-c0d3557072d4&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeanCMS supports syntax highlighting for codeblocks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;1cede03e-e15e-4c3a-b545-0d6494853c08&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeanCMS supports other features you&#x27;d want in a blog or note taking app, such as image upload, hotkeys, and table of contents support.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;e1af1679-f659-4f5e-95c5-a5bafb31d1da&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab the raw Markdown of a post by appending &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;raw&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to any post url.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Atom feeds are enabled for all user blogs by appending &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;feed&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to a user&#x27;s profile url!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video controls src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;290d9738-9a35-4243-ba6a-d9a6d27deac9&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;video&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;admin-panel&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#admin-panel&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: admin-panel&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Admin Panel&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeanCMS comes with an included admin panel only accessible to a list of specified IP Addresses. By default, only &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is allowed to access the admin panel, which provides information such as registered users, active sessions, uploaded images, and storage usage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;github.com&amp;#x2F;user-attachments&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;75705555-24c5-41d7-a6f8-bbb41aebc56b&quot; alt=&quot;admin page&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-it-out&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#try-it-out&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: try-it-out&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Try it out!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BeanCMS was intended as a hyper minimal blogging&#x2F;note-taking app that I can self-host for myself and friends. Thanks to redbean, deployment is fast, tiny, and dead simple. A huge thanks to Redbean and Cosmopolitan Libc maintainers for building such a brilliant tool. And an enormous thanks to Paul Kulchenko for providing clarity and creating &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pkulchenko&#x2F;fullmoon&quot;&gt;Fullmoon&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a minimal but batteries-included web framework for Redbean.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never done a retrospective, but I&#x27;ve been inspired by a peer at work to start doing a recap of accomplishments, changes, and wishlist items for the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-did-in-2024&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-did-in-2024&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-did-in-2024&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I did in 2024&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got married&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Last year in 2023, I proposed to my now-wife while on an international trip. I had planned out the time and location of the proposal to be done on a beach following an all-day biking excursion; I had even scouted out the exact spot beforehand using Google Maps street view. Unfortunately, the day of was marked by abnormally bad weather; the entire biking excursion was overshadowed by cloudy skies and intermittent rain. By the time we arrived on the beach, the sand was muddy and we were wet and exhausted. In the end, I improvised a proposal during a quiet moment while we were visiting a river-side tea town. I forgot my entire speech and even forgot to kneel, but she said &quot;yes&quot;. We got married on September 14th, 2024, in a small ceremony with only our direct family in my mother-in-law&#x27;s living room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bought a house&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. After getting married, we made the offer to buy the home we were already renting. We managed to get a good deal and even sorted out a seller-financing agreement for the first three years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopted &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113318071110352461&quot;&gt;Matcha&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In June&#x2F;July, we began fostering Matcha, a 1 year old bengal cat who had fallen from a third-story balcony and required a leg amputation. After a couple of months, my wife had fallen in love with him, and sheepishly asked me if he could stay. I had a hard time saying no. He&#x27;s a constant trouble-maker, but we love him all the same.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Became Engineering Lead&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In April of 2024, my boss resigned and recommended me to replace him. It was admittedly nerve-racking since I had never been in any kind of management role. That was over eight months ago now, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve become somewhat used to the role, although I admit that I still prefer being hands-on. I&#x27;m very grateful to my wonderful team of engineers, designer(s), and product managers who helped fill in where I fell short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned how to ski&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In February, I made a trip to Breckinridge, Colorado with my father and father-in-law, and finally learned how to ski. My father-in-law is an avid skiier (sp?) and great teacher. After three days, I got the hang of it, albeit I was exhausted by that point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made the switch to Fedora with KDE on my work PC&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In 2024, I transitioned my work PC to running Fedora with KDE full-time. It has been frankly &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; Fedora is stable, has built-in Flatpak support, and up-to-date packages in the Fedora repository. And moving to KDE from GNOME has been wonderful, as KDE includes such a large breadth of mature features and customization where the GNOME equivalents would usually come in the form of buggy extensions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiked up &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113320193005275471&quot;&gt;Grandfather Mountain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (kind of)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. On a trip to North Carolina for my wife&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s wedding, we took the time to hike up Grandfather Mountain. The sights and weather were mostly beautiful. Unfortunately, we chose the day of the ceremony for the hike, and half way through the hike it began raining. A steep cliff climb was made more treacherous by slippery rocks, so we decided to play it safe and turn around to make it to the ceremony without broken bones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113325978873697565&quot;&gt;ceiling fan in our office&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. My mother-in-law had an extra ceiling fan lying around from her employer. My father-in-law volunteered to come over and help me install it. I honestly could not have done it without him. It looks great, and I&#x27;m happy with the result.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosted a holiday party&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For seven years, my friends have gathered in South Florida for what has now become a holiday party where we do a Secret Santa and White Elephant gift exchange. As the years have passed, the number of attendees has grown to about fifteen as we began including friends, girlfriends, and spouses. I hung up lights in the backyard, pressure washed the pavers, bought a large used outdoor rug, decorated the home, and made a charcuterie board while my wife prepared a Christmas lasagna, mulled wine and other goodies. My brother constructed a gingerbread house, and other attendees brought more great food and tons of beer. Overall it was a fun time reconnecting with friends I hadn&#x27;t seen all year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ran another 5K&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I haven&#x27;t been the best at staying in shape, but this year, my wife signed us up for another 5K. We were both able to beat our times from last year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stayed at a barn AirBNB&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. While visiting my brother in West Florida, we stayed a small AirBnB location owned by a couple living on a farm. They had renovated the second floor of their barn to be a cozy little AirBnB location. We spent our time exploring the farm, meeting the goats and cows, donned beekeeper outfits and handled a bee colony, and went to the zoo with my brother and nieces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got into retro handhelds&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For better or for worse, I became obsessed with the retro handheld hobby after a close friend purchased an RG35XX Plus for me as a birthday gift. I purchased multiple devices aftwards including the Anbernic RG Arc second-hand on OfferUp. I even forked an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keb&#x2F;brrrrrrrrrrr&quot;&gt;existing firmware&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and began customizing it to my liking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113783176034636797&quot;&gt;ropes course&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Knowing full well that I&#x27;m terrified of heights, my wife bought us passes to a ropes course. Despite my fear of heights, I had a blast (although I should wear more sunscreen next time).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attended an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Idles&quot;&gt;IDLES&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; show&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve seen a band play live, and IDLES made their way down to Ft. Lauderdale this year. I attended with my brother and learned that in my early thirties, I&#x27;m not able to mosh for very long before I&#x27;m gasping for water.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made strides in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113374758078465406&quot;&gt;organizing the tools in the garage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Our tool storage has been a mess for years. The norm has been to scatter the tools on the floor in the corner of the garage and squat down to look every time we need a tool. I bought a small workbench from Walmart and installed Wall Control panels on the conrete wall. In addition, I installed hooks to the left of the workbench where I now hang ladders. It still needs some work, but it&#x27;s been a huge quality of life improvement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bought a chest freezer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. We&#x27;ve always struggled with the little space in our main freezer, so we bought a chest freezer from Walmart and installed it in the garage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I began volunteering to transport food to a local high school&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Together with my parents, I now volunteer every Sunday to transport near-expired food from Trader Joe&#x27;s to a local high school.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Went white-water rafting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. While in North Carolina, I went white-water rafting with my wife for the first time in ~20 years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attended FIU&#x27;s Brew Fest&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Together with my wife, I attended FIU&#x27;s Brew Fest, and drank all sorts of delicious craft beer. Even food was included in the ticket, and we enjoyed burgers, croquetas, Argentinian steak, and much more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ate &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@kevinf&#x2F;113783230407604096&quot;&gt;authentic Thai home-cooked food&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I&#x27;ve been to multiple amazing Thai restaurants in the last year, but Gai Chicken and Rice in Fort Lauderdale takes the cake when it comes to making aunthentic home-cooked meals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completed &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keb.im&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;&quot;&gt;12 video games&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Hoping I have time to complete more this year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moved my personal email to Purelymail.com&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I&#x27;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;migadu.com&quot;&gt;Migadu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for my personal email since 2019, but this year, I&#x27;ve finally switched over all of my domains to using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purelymail.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Purelymail&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I was able to make the migration within a couple hours, and have been loving the Roundcube webmail interface so far, greatly preferring it to Rainloop (or its fork).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migrated my personal servers to Caddy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I&#x27;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linuxserver&#x2F;docker-swag&quot;&gt;SWAG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for years now to manage my personal servers as it greatly simplifies having to deal with reverse proxies. After some frustration over adding basic auth to one of my apps, I tried out Caddy and was blown away at the simplicity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified my Sublime Text configs&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For years, I struggled with finding a way to organize and persist my Sublime Text config across multiple machines. I tried the Sync Settings plugin, then tried manually keeping Gists on Github updated and bookmarked, but was never happy with the setup especially considering I use Sublime Text across Windows and Linux. This year, I&#x27;ve resolved to simply committing the &lt;code&gt;Packages&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;keb&#x2F;sublime-packages&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and using &lt;code&gt;(Windows)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(Linux)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;-suffixed preference files. So far, it has worked fantastically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-programmed-in-2024&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#things-i-programmed-in-2024&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: things-i-programmed-in-2024&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Things I programmed in 2024&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I moved to using a bunch of my own self-hosted services. I keep a repository of Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files, etc. in a Git repository on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;keb&#x2F;elster&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which I clone and use across a VPS and my Raspberry Pi.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My updates to the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.js.org&#x2F;installation.html&quot;&gt;Mithril.js Installation document&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were finally merged. This was a source of pain for several years as the instructions were outdated, referencing an old version of Webpack which led to numerous confused users entering the Mithril.js chat asking for clarification. Along with the doc updates, I created templates for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;mithril-esbuild-starter&quot;&gt;esbuild&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;mithril-rollup-starter&quot;&gt;rollup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;keb&#x2F;cf-pages-cli&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;keb&#x2F;cf-pages-cli&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - I wanted to deploy some sites to Cloudflare Pages, but found Cloudflare&#x27;s Wrangler CLI to be absurdly large and complicated for just deploying static sites. &lt;code&gt;cf-pages-cli&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; rewrites parts of Wrangler while vendoring in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;terkelg&#x2F;globrex&quot;&gt;globrex&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The result is a smaller and more focused CLI tool for deploying to Cloudflare Pages, and I&#x27;ve been happy that it&#x27;s been working great for 9 months now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keb&#x2F;brrrrrrrrrrr&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keb&#x2F;brrrrrrrrrrr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - a fork of a firmware that simply boots into Retroarch for the RG Arc, running the RK3566 chip. It&#x27;s a minimal but fast solution to playing retro games on the go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;make_readable&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;make_readable&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - Every now and then, I need readability mode in a browser that doesn&#x27;t support it. This is a Deno app that wraps Mozilla&#x27;s Readability library, allowing me to quickly get a readable version of a web article regardless of what browser I&#x27;m using.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;markdown_file_links&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;markdown_file_links&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - In my envy of rich note taking apps like Obsidian, but also my stubbornness to continue using a copy of Sublime Text 3 as my main note-taking app, I built a tiny plugin for Sublime Text 3&#x2F;4 that enables file links.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;youtube-random&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;youtube-random&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - I wrote a tiny service that will return a random YouTube video URL for a given channel. I used this to expand &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with a &quot;Picks from your subscriptions&quot; section, which helps me discover videos from my existing subscriptions. It&#x27;s been wonderful so far.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;arkive&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;arkive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - A personal web archive built with Deno. This has been working just fine for me locally for months now, but has been suffering from feature creep as my original scope has expanded to turn it into a general purpose bookmarks tool. I intend to deploy the minimal version in 2025, and expand upon it with a refactored fork in 2025.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai-vite&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai-vite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - My personal UI library, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai&quot;&gt;umai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has seen numerous bugfixes and improvements over the last year. In addition, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;react-patterns-in-umai&#x2F;&quot;&gt;React Patterns in Umai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for those interested in checking it out. In addition, I created a simple Vite template complete with TypeScript to help developers get started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;See the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For our &quot;honeymoon&quot;, my wife and I will be renting a camper van, and traveling through Arizona, Utah and Nevada to see the Grand Canyon, Zion, and other amazing sights.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Install new blinds in the office&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The blinds in the office currently let in far too much light and heat, making the workday uncomfortably hot in the afternoon. I&#x27;ve already ordered new blackout celullar shades and intend to install them soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Install an irrigation system and place new sod in the backyard&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The backyard has needed a redo in a while. I hope to be able to rip up the old pavers, and start fresh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do a rock-climbing course&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. My wife got me a pass to a rock-climbing gym for Christmas. While I&#x27;m still afraid of heights, I&#x27;ll be happy to share the experience and memories with her.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deep-dive into Postgres&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I used continuing education funds to purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;masteringpostgres.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Mastering Postgres&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Hoping to learn some tricks to improve the scalability of my applications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get back into gamedev&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. I took a pause from gamedev for a couple years, but this year I hope to get back into LOVE2D and Lua while learning some essential gamedev math from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fjOdtSu4Lm4&amp;amp;list=PLImQaTpSAdsArRFFj8bIfqMk2X7Vlf3XF&quot;&gt;Freya Holmér&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; YouTube course and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.godotengine.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;math&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;Godot docs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Build a micro-CMS with Redbean&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is something I&#x27;ve started and have a lot of momentum with already going into 2025. I&#x27;ve been wanting to build something significant with Redbean for a while, and I&#x27;m making great progress so far. I hope to build the Markdown-based CMS system I&#x27;ve always wanted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Start practicing guitar again&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. While I love playing songs on my guitar, my skill level has plateaud for several years now..&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Switch my personal PC to Linux&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This year, I hope to finally move my personal PC from Windows 10 to Fedora KDE. For years, I have stayed on Windows for video game compatibility. This year, I intend to go all-in on Proton and finally modernizing my personal PC development environment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Finalize and deploy &lt;code&gt;arkive&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As mentioned, it&#x27;s working well, but I would like to limit the scope of it this year and deploy an MVP.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I forked &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jorgebucaran&#x2F;hyperapp&quot;&gt;hyperapp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to create the single-page application library I&#x27;ve always wanted -- &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai&quot;&gt;umai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. umai is heavily influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.js.org&quot;&gt;Mithril.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which has unfortunately been in stasis for a few years now. My goal in creating umai can be summed up in a few bullet points:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a hyper minimal, but ergonomic UI library in a tiny package size (~1.7kb)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully embrace Mithril.js&#x27;s closure components, while cutting the cruft and unnecessary baggage (class components, object components, lifecycle events, &lt;code&gt;view&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; property).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full tree redraws on event handler calls with support for async handlers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve used umai on multiple small personal projects and have been happy with the speed and minimalism I&#x27;ve been able to rebuild apps I had previously written in React, Mithril, and Svelte.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&#x27;d like to translate React patterns taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&quot;&gt;react.dev&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; into umai equivalents to demonstrate how easy it is for someone with previous SPA experience to get started with umai. I&#x27;ll be providing links to live examples if you&#x27;d like to alter the examples.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s start with a very basic example of component composition. Being able to reuse components is the bread and butter of any UI library.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;react&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: react&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;React&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;div&amp;gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice anything interesting? They&#x27;re both the same! If you&#x27;re used to stateless components in React, moving to umai will be a breeze. This includes basics like props and conditional rendering. The following example is compatible with React and umai:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-jsx &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; MyButton() {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      I&amp;#39;m a button
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;button&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  );
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; MyApp({ showButton = &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; } = {}) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcome to my app&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;h1&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;showButton ? &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MyButton &#x2F;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; : &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Button is hidden!&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;div&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  );
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s get started with examples that contain actual differences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;updating-the-screen&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#updating-the-screen&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: updating-the-screen&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&#x2F;learn#updating-the-screen&quot;&gt;Updating the screen&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;react-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react-1&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: react-1&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;React&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic state management takes center stage for this example. In React, we&#x27;ll use the familiar &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hook to create a reusable component that retains its own state.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-jsx &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; { useState } &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;react&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; MyApp() {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Counters that update separately&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;h1&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MyButton &#x2F;&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;MyButton &#x2F;&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;div&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  );
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; MyButton() {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; [count, setCount] = useState(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; handleClick() {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    setCount(count + &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt; onClick&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;={&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;handleClick&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;}&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      Clicked &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;count&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; times

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  );
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;umai-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#umai-1&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: umai-1&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;umai&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;umai does not feature hooks.

State is defined using simple, mutable variables declared with &lt;code&gt;let&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few important distinctions to be made with the umai version:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;umai uses browser standard names for event handlers (&lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice that the &lt;code&gt;handleClick&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; function in React will be re-created on every re-render. This is because React components are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; render functions. Hooks are needed to get around this limitation and to store stateful data in a hidden global store invisible to the developer. When declaring stateful components with umai, instead of returning JSX, we return a &lt;strong&gt;render function&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This forms a closure that retains the state of the &lt;strong&gt;outer function&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. &lt;code&gt;handleClick&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the umai version is only created once.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means no need for &lt;code&gt;useCallback&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;! Memoizing components is much simpler in umai.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you need access to the DOM, whether it be to integrate with a third-party library or trigger DOM-specific effects. In React, a &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; can be used to attach a DOM node to a variable accessible to React, often using the &lt;code&gt;useRef&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hook.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In umai, every element has a special &lt;code&gt;dom&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; property which accepts a handler that receives the DOM node upon creation. Using a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; variable, we can grab a reference to this node and use it at a later time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React heavily relies on the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hook for usecases involving:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running code on mounting of a component&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running code on dependency updates (whether it be state or props)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running code on unmounting of a component&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running code related to external systems (the DOM, third-party libraries, etc.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hook famously replaced every lifecycle event used when class components were idiomatic React.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-jsx &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Counter() {

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; intervalId = setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      setCount(c =&amp;gt; c + &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }, &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1000&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }, []);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;count&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;}&amp;lt;&#x2F;h1&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, umai is much more minimal. There is no special API for effects. However, we can re-use an existing concept we touched on earlier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handler passed to the &lt;code&gt;dom&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; property is only called once upon DOM node creation. Therefore, we can leverage it to run effects on &quot;component mount&quot;. Additionally, a cleanup function can be returned in this handler to run code upon element removal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting things to note:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since stateful components in umai are &quot;closure components&quot;, we don&#x27;t have to keep track of dependencies with dependency arrays like in React -- the outer function is only run once on component mount.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;umai uses &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai?tab=readme-ov-file#redraws--state-management&quot;&gt;global redraws&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot;. Rerenders are only triggered by event handlers defined in your JSX, or by manual &lt;code&gt;redraw()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; calls. During asynchronous operations, calling &lt;code&gt;redraw()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is necessary to tell umai to re-render.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-a-reducer-to-a-component&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#adding-a-reducer-to-a-component&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: adding-a-reducer-to-a-component&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&#x2F;reference&#x2F;react&#x2F;useReducer#adding-a-reducer-to-a-component&quot;&gt;Adding a reducer to a component&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React&#x27;s &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; hook allows developers to implement an immutable store similar to Redux. A nice thing about this pattern is multi-property state alterations can be designated as &quot;actions&quot; which may optionally contain payloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have already guessed, but umai does not feature any reducer methods or utilities to build a store. However, you may leverage any store&#x2F;observable library to implement your own, such as dipole, preact-signals, MobX, Immer, or even Redux. Below, I give an example using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;vyce&quot;&gt;vyce&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a 463 byte observable store. Notice that the reducer is unchanged from the React example.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using strings to name actions, we simply use functions, e.g., &lt;code&gt;incrementAge&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;createActions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; factory function produces a unique actions bag &lt;em&gt;scoped&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to the state object passed to it. These actions are the only means of updating the state.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat of this approach is that it is still possible to mutate the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; object directly. If you are using TypeScript, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;utility-types.html#readonlytype&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Readonly&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; utility type to discourage this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;createState &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= (): State &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({ age: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;42 &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;});

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;actions &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;createActions&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;age &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;10&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; Cannot assign to &amp;#39;age&amp;#39; because it is a read-only property.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing to point out is that React &lt;strong&gt;batches state updates&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is to prevent unncessary re-renders upon updating multiple state variables. For example, if you call &lt;code&gt;setState(x =&amp;gt; x + 1)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; 3 times in a row, React will only re-render once. This is a smart and sophisticated optimization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of optimization is &lt;strong&gt;unneeded&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in umai. Whereas the developer must remember the rules of re-rendering in React as it pertains to several hooks, umai only re-renders in these two instances:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An event handler is called, e.g., &lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onchange&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;oninput&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;redraw()&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is called&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wait-so-should-i-migrate-to-umai&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#wait-so-should-i-migrate-to-umai&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: wait-so-should-i-migrate-to-umai&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Wait, so should I migrate to umai?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai&quot;&gt;umai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is very much a work-in-progress, a one-man hobby project, and not as feature-filled as React or Mithril.js for that matter. At the time of writing, umai is at version &lt;code&gt;0.2.6&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Here is a short list of things React has that umai does not:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSR support -- there is currently no way to render umai components with Node&#x2F;Deno&#x2F;Bun&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyed fragment support&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling and useful error messaging&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer Tools&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Waku)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile frameworks like React Native&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I think there is value in comparing it to React, if only to see what else is possible in the realm of uncompiled, single-page application libraries. I firmly believe the patterns presented by umai, and its main inspiration (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.js.org&quot;&gt;Mithril.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) are viable alternatives. And, in my opinion, these patterns are &lt;em&gt;better&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; than the status quo set by React and Facebook&#x2F;Meta. For that reason, I do encourage anyone with a small, low-stakes hobby project in mind to take &lt;code&gt;umai&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for a spin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more examples of umai in action, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;umai?tab=readme-ov-file#examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; section of the README.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/modern-bundling-with-esbuild/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;modern-bundling-with-esbuild&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#modern-bundling-with-esbuild&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: modern-bundling-with-esbuild&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Modern bundling with esbuild&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, you can get a pretty robust build setup for a modern browser app using just &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;esbuild&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The benefits of using esbuild over rollup, webpack, or parcel are numerous, but the few that stand out to me are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esbuild ships as a static binary; in practice this means adding it as a dependency won&#x27;t bloat your project with npm packages&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that lack of npm packages also means less dependabot alerts, since the less dependencies your project relies on, the less likely it is to be vulnerable to security concerns&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esbuild&#x27;s bundle times are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; faster than rollup&#x2F;webpack&#x2F;parcel&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esbuild includes support for TypeScript and JSX transpilation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s a lot of bang for your buck for a single dev dependency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dead-simple-setup&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#dead-simple-setup&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: dead-simple-setup&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Dead-simple setup&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, install esbuild in your project if you haven&#x27;t already.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;npm&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; install&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --save-dev&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; esbuild
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use esbuild via CLI or its Node API. For tiny apps where your build config is practically non-existent, using the CLI is fine. You can simply define a script in your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file and be ready to go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild index.js --bundle --minify --outfile=.&#x2F;dist&#x2F;app.js&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a script like the one above, run &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and your lightning-fast build is there, minified in all its glory. This isn&#x27;t terribly different than what you can already do with webpack, but when was the last time you saw webpack&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npm.anvaka.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;view&#x2F;2d&#x2F;webpack&quot;&gt;dependency graph&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? And that doesn&#x27;t even include &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;npm.anvaka.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;view&#x2F;2d&#x2F;webpack-cli&quot;&gt;webpack-cli&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Not to rag on webpack; it is an immensely powerful tool that many great projects rely on, but unless you&#x27;re already tangled in that web (heh), I&#x27;d suggest steering clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;esbuild also includes a built-in watch mode. No extra plugins needed! Let&#x27;s go ahead and define another script:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild index.js --outfile=dist&#x2F;app.js --bundle --minify&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;dev&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild index.js --outfile=dist&#x2F;app.js --bundle --sourcemap --watch&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make changes to &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and you&#x27;ll see that &lt;code&gt;dist&#x2F;app.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is re-bundled automatically. It&#x27;s even got source map support! Alternatively, we could take things a step further and utilize esbuild&#x27;s built-in server. Let&#x27;s change the &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; script a bit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild index.js --outfile=dist&#x2F;app.js --bundle --minify&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;dev&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild src&#x2F;index.jsx --outfile=dist&#x2F;app.js --servedir=dist --bundle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running dev, you&#x27;ll see in your terminal that a server has been started. Navigate to &lt;code&gt;localhost:8000&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to see the contents of your &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; folder hosted locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; npm run dev

&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering where your generated output files are, no worries: esbuild&#x27;s serve mode serves the bundled files directly from memory. They are never written to your disk unless you intentionally omit the &lt;code&gt;servedir&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; variable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-build-api&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#using-the-build-api&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: using-the-build-api&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Using the Build API&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring our buildstep via CLI flags can get unwieldy over time. With other bundlers, you get the benefit of config files, e.g., &lt;code&gt;rollup.config.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. With esbuild, we can just use plain old Node scripts plus the existing Node APIs to configure our builds. Start by creating a new &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file under a directory for scripts, &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;build.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Then, change our existing &lt;code&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; script in our &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;node .&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;build.js&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#x27;t do anything yet, because &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;build.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is empty. Let&#x27;s fix that by translating our previous build CLI call to a Node script. That will look something like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; scripts&#x2F;build.js

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{ &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;resolve &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;} &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;path&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;});
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; should function the same as before, but now we have more control over our bundles! But what about our dev script? And what if we want to reduce code duplication? After all, &lt;code&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; are very similar with just a couple different options.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s create a new file in our scripts folder, called &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;bundle.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that will contain the config that both &lt;code&gt;build.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dev.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; scripts&#x2F;bundle.js
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;esbuild &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;esbuild&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{ &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;resolve &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;} &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;path&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;export function &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;config &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= {}) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;return &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;esbuild&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;build&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    format: &amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;iife&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    entryPoints: [&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;)],
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    bundle: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ...&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;config
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  });
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you see, &lt;code&gt;bundle.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will contain all of our default configs. Let&#x27;s refactor &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;build.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to specifically create one minified build:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; scripts&#x2F;build.js

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({ minify: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;true &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;})
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  .&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;then&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(() &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  });
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our build script should now function like before. Let&#x27;s create &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;dev.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; now:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; scripts&#x2F;dev.js

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; script to your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You very well could use esbuild&#x27;s &quot;serve&quot; mode in your &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;dev.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; script if you&#x27;d like to. You would have to adjust the scripts we&#x27;ve created so that &quot;dev&quot; mode uses &lt;code&gt;esbuild.serve&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;esbuild.build&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. While I like that esbuild has a built-in server, it does not support live-reload, which is a nice feature to have. You could implement your own live reload using &lt;code&gt;esbuild.serve&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, but a simpler solution would be to include some kind of server in our project as a dev dependency. I&#x27;ve found that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nativew&#x2F;serve&quot;&gt;nativew&#x2F;serve&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was a fine candidate for this. At &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packagephobia.com&#x2F;result?p=create-serve&quot;&gt;18.7kb&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with 0 dependencies, it was a guilt-free inclusion. Install with npm as normal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (12&#x2F;18&#x2F;2021):&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Since writing this article, I&#x27;ve published a fork of lukejacksonn&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lukejacksonn&#x2F;servor&quot;&gt;servor&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; project titled &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;servbot&quot;&gt;servbot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is smaller in scope and intended to be used with existing JS build tools. My move away from &lt;strong&gt;nativew&#x2F;serve&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was motivated by its lack of SPA support. The instructions below have been updated for &lt;strong&gt;servbot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;npm&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; install&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --save-dev&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; servbot
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&#x27;s modify our &lt;code&gt;scripts&#x2F;dev.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; scripts&#x2F;dev.js
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;servbot &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;servbot&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;import &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{ &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bundle &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;} &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;from &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;.&#x2F;bundle.js&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; create server
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;server &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;servbot&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;});
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-run &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and we&#x27;ll have our live-reloading dev server up:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for whatever reason you&#x27;ve made it this far and are not convinced and maybe want a more batteries-included solution, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitejs.dev&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from Vue.js creator, Evan You. Vite actually uses esbuild for its own development mode to bundle vendor packages. Otherwise, I hope this has encouraged you to dig deeper into esbuild and to not be afraid to get your hands dirty in writing custom Node scripts to do your bundling. Sometimes what webpack and rollup do under the hood can seem like black magic since it&#x27;s all abstracted away from you, basking in the comfort of a small config json file at the root of your project. You can cut away at a lot of that cruft by using simpler tools like esbuild, and get perf benefits and a better understanding of your tooling to boot!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-minimal-rss-feed-reader/"/>
        <id>https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-minimal-rss-feed-reader/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/a-minimal-rss-feed-reader/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-minimal-rss-feed-reader&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-minimal-rss-feed-reader&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-minimal-rss-feed-reader&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A minimal RSS Feed Reader&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;reader&#x2F;&quot;&gt;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;reader&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for my new daily RSS reader, updated hourly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mid-2020, I had been using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inoreader.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Inoreader&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as my main RSS&#x2F;Atom feed reader. Inoreader offers a generous free tier, giving you a maximum of 150 feeds per account, as well as a bunch of QoL features like search, bookmarking, and a dashboard with reasonable amounts of customization. The free tier is ad-supported which is understandable. For the most part, the ads are unintrusive. Using an adblocker such as uBlock Origin ocassionally results in a popup reminder by Inoreader that their free tier is ad-supported, kindly asking you to disable your adblock.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I had also come across George Mandis&#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;georgemandis&#x2F;bubo-rss&quot;&gt;Bubo Reader&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, an &quot;irrationally minimalist, static RSS feed reader you can instantly deploy on Netlify, Glitch or your own server.&quot; George has a great introductory blogpost on his site &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;george.mand.is&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;introducing-bubo-rss-an-absurdly-minimalist-rss-feed-reader&#x2F;&quot;&gt;over here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which I recommend reading if the description I gave seemed interesting at all. TL;DR: Bubo Reader is nothing but a static .html page that gets rebuilt and redeployed via a Node.js script. The script will be run at a set interval, fetch the latest posts from feeds (defined in a .json file), and &lt;em&gt;boom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; you got a new &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file with a couple &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; lists of the latest articles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first checked out George&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bubo-rss-demo.netlify.app&#x2F;&quot;&gt;demo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Bubo Reader, I simultaneously thought &quot;wow this is cool!&quot; and also &quot;wow this is crappy!&quot;. My latter thought stemmed from the fact that the demo is really &lt;em&gt;irrationally&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; minimal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genius of Bubo Reader is summarized in a few points that I realized slowly over the past year:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feed reader doesn&#x27;t need to be updated too frequently.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Inoreader will refresh your feeds and even update the page dynamically if there are any new items. But why the desperation for new content to consume? I realized that Inoreader enabled my bad habit of seeking the dopamine boost that comes with getting something &quot;new.&quot; You know what I&#x27;m talking about -- it&#x27;s the same reason why immediately after closing your reddit tab, your first instinct is to Ctrl+T and go back to reddit. It&#x27;s an unhealthy craving because there is always some new article to skim, comments section to meander about, or funny gif to laugh at instead of doing something productive. In George&#x27;s Bubo Reader example, the feed is updated every 15 minutes. Personally, I find that 1 hour is the perfect inverval.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feed reader doesn&#x27;t really need a bookmarks manager.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I had quit Pocket and given up on Instapaper. I thought maybe my feed reader can be my bookmarks tool. The issue was that Inoreader is clumsy to bookmark articles or content that you find &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of your feed, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if other readers had the same issue. In addition, every modern browser has a bookmarking feature, and inevitably, your bookmarks will become split between your browser&#x27;s built in bookmarks, and your feed reader&#x27;s bookmarks. I gave up on this division. Firefox now handles all of my bookmarks and it syncs between devices using a Firefox Account.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feed reader doesn&#x27;t need to be able to scrape article contents.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Probably 6 times out of 10, Inoreader would mess up the content scraping anyway, which in the age of SPAs and paywalls, is not surprising. Even when it scraped things properly, I still prefered to read the article on the site it originated on with Firefox&#x27;s reader mode.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feed reader doesn&#x27;t need client-side JavaScript.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Shocking, I know. There are certainly some niceties that can only be had with JavaScript, but I found George&#x27;s use of &lt;code&gt;details&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; elements to be exactly what I needed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&#x27;t need a mobile app.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I don&#x27;t like staring at my phone for long periods of time. In general, I think it&#x27;s not a great habit. While Bubo Reader can be viewed in a browser, I don&#x27;t use it that way. If I did, I could easily put some time in to make my version mobile responsive.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;reader&quot;&gt;forked&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Bubo Reader and made several personalized changes and improvements. In addition to a dark mode, I took inspiration from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;john-doe.neocities.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;John Doe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; webpage that was a bit popular on Hacker News some time ago, using the CSS &lt;code&gt;:target&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; selector to create a &quot;sidebar&quot; for my reader. In addition, I adjusted the build script to sort feeds by the most latest updated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;reader&#x2F;&quot;&gt;kevinfiol.com&#x2F;reader&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/mithriljs-esbuild-jsx/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;mithril-js-esbuild-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#mithril-js-esbuild-jsx&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: mithril-js-esbuild-jsx&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Mithril.js + esbuild + JSX&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 7&#x2F;18&#x2F;2022:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; esbuild has since added support for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evanw&#x2F;esbuild&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1217&quot;&gt;string literals as JSX fragments&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, meaning much of what I wrote below is now unnecessary. To use JSX with Mithril and esbuild, all you need to do is set &lt;code&gt;jsxFragment: &#x27;&quot;[&quot;&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your esbuild config. See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;newt&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;bundle.js&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for an example.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently bootstrapped a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.js.org&quot;&gt;Mithril.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; project using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;esbuild&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for my bundling purposes. If you don&#x27;t already know, esbuild is a next-gen bundler written in Go by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evanw&quot;&gt;Evan Wallace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that is magnitudes faster than rollup, webpack, or parcel (all of which are written in JS&#x2F;TS).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;esbuild comes with JSX support out of the box. While I don&#x27;t normally use JSX, I decided to create a demo for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.netlify.app&quot;&gt;mithril.netlify.app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; showing off that JSX works just fine in a Mithril application. However, I ran into one major issue -- esbuild wasn&#x27;t compiling JSX fragments correctly when providing &lt;code&gt;m.fragment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as the JSX fragment pragma.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging around, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;mithriljs&#x2F;mithril.js?at=5b98ce1c51a02e2a261ac656&quot;&gt;this comment&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;isiahmeadows&quot;&gt;Claudia Meadows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there&#x27;s no support for Mithril fragments as Components currently. esbuild (as well as transpilers like Sucrase) compiles JSX using the provided jsx pragma + jsx fragment method in the form of:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;React&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;React&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Fragment&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;null&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;Stuff&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;api&#x2F;#jsx-fragment&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for more details.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which in Mithril&#x27;s case, can&#x27;t work with &lt;code&gt;m.fragment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Following Claudia&#x27;s advice, defining a simple Fragment component as so worked for me. I just put this in my &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file near the top:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;m&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Fragment &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= { &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;view&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;vnode &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;vnode&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;children &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;};
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I just set &lt;code&gt;jsxFragment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;m.Fragment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;m.fragment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in my esbuild config and voilà! Fragments work as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;JSX &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= {

&lt;p&gt;About six years ago, I purchased a ROCCAT Savu gaming mouse to serve as my daily driver. The mouse itself was mediocre, but the bundled Windows-only software included a feature that I enabled on a whim that allowed the user to hold a button on the side of the mouse and use the scroll wheel to control the system volume. I didn&#x27;t think much of the feature. A couple years later when my Savu finally died, I replaced it with a Logitech G203, only to find that controlling the system volume with the scroll wheel had become second nature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;windows&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#windows&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: windows&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Windows&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Logitech&#x27;s software included ways to bind keys to mouse buttons, and using an &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;e7a915a3ed6f1f3e6d5f745633b61617&quot;&gt;Autohotkey script&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to fake an &lt;code&gt;F13&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; key press, I was able to bind my mouse button to a non-existent key. Afterwards, I simply launch another &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kevinfiol&#x2F;9214d92033fc6a6784a607c97aa50838&quot;&gt;Autohotkey script&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on system startup to have system-wide volume control bound to my mouse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of consumer-grade peripheral software on Linux is getting better by the day, but still severely lacking compared to Windows. For the most part, you should be fine with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libratbag&#x2F;piper&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Piper&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for your gaming mouse needs on Linux. However, Piper itself is insufficient for our goals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was able to achieve similar functionality to the Autohotkey script above using &lt;code&gt;xbindkeys&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xdotool&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, both of which you can install using your package manager:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# Ubuntu
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; apt update
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; apt install xbindkeys xdotool
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;~&#x2F;.xbindkeysrc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your home directory and paste:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;xdotool keydown ctrl&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    b:8
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;xdotool keyup ctrl&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    release + control + b:8
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -5%&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    control + b:5
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +5%&amp;quot;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    control + b:4
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;killall xbindkeys &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xbindkeys&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to restart xbindkeys.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things to note:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find xbindkeys keycodes using &lt;code&gt;xbindkeys --key&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or mouse button codes using &lt;code&gt;xev&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am binding the side button on my mouse &lt;code&gt;b:8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to the Control key on my keyboard using &lt;code&gt;xdotool&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This may or may not work for you if you already bind your Control key to something else. What this means in practice is that holding your mouse button is essentially like holding the Control key.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a particular point of frustration on Linux, as it seems xbindkeys is very selective of what keys can be used as modifiers. The manpage lists &lt;code&gt;Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock), Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4 (Super), Mod5 (Scroll)&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as available modifiers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commands &lt;code&gt;pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -5%&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 +5%&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; assume you are using the PulseAudio sound driver. These commands may not work for you if you&#x27;re using the ALSA sound driver, in which case, you may use commands like &lt;code&gt;amixer -q sset Master 5%-&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;amixer -q sset Master 5%+&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; respectively. If neither of these work, try &lt;code&gt;amixer -q -D pulse sset Master 5%+&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;amixer -q -D pulse sset Master 5%-&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, or research how to control your master volume by command line on your system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-or-how-to-bind-the-super-key-03-08-2022&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#update-or-how-to-bind-the-super-key-03-08-2022&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: update-or-how-to-bind-the-super-key-03-08-2022&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Update, or, how to bind the Super key (03&#x2F;08&#x2F;2022)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year later, I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hanschen&#x2F;ksuperkey&quot;&gt;ksuperkey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and further &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jixunmoe&#x2F;xfce-superkey&quot;&gt;xfce-superkey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (I am an XFCE user). Last year, I avoided binding to the Super key because more often than not, this will interfere with existing keybinds in DEs where the Super key opens the Applications menu. This is the case in XFCE where the Super key is used to open the Whisker Menu. While you can simply rebind your Applications shortcut to something other than &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, I personally find it hard to deprogram this instinct. The above utilities allow you to keep &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as your sole shortcut to &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; but also allow you to use it in other keyboard combinations. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; if you use XFCE, you still have to unbind Whisker Menu from &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in your Keyboard settings -- don&#x27;t worry though, you&#x27;ll still be able to use &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; after running &lt;code&gt;xfce-superkey&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. After installing the above utility, I changed my &lt;code&gt;.xbindkeysrc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;xdotool keydown Super_R keydown ctrl&amp;quot;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/getting-rid-of-the-credential-helper-selector-on-git-for-windows/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-rid-of-the-credential-helper-selector-on-git-for-windows&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#getting-rid-of-the-credential-helper-selector-on-git-for-windows&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: getting-rid-of-the-credential-helper-selector-on-git-for-windows&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Getting rid of the Credential Helper Selector on Git for Windows&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever been tormented by the following pop-up when trying to push or pull from an HTTPS Git origin:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;credential_helper&amp;#x2F;helper.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Windows Credential Helper Selector&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a way out of your misery. Initially I thought that if I added my Git credentials for the respective remote origin directly into my &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file, Git for Windows would stop prompting me every time I wanted to push or pull. Nope. And even more painful is that &lt;strong&gt;for some unknown reason&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the pop-up would appear &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; no matter what -- even if I selected &lt;code&gt;Always use this from now on&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-to&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-to&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How to&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, you can simply choose to not install the Helper Selector by unchecking a box during the installation process of Git for Windows. This is assuming you are installing Git in this manner, and also that you are willing to reinstall Git for Windows entirely or re-run the installer. But what if this doesn&#x27;t apply to you?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed Git using &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scoop.sh&quot;&gt;scoop.sh&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, so my installation process took place entirely via CLI. However, I guess this option also assumes you want the Credential Helper since I don&#x27;t remember ever specifying I wanted it. So what now?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unset-the-credential-helper-system-wide&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#unset-the-credential-helper-system-wide&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: unset-the-credential-helper-system-wide&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Unset the credential helper system-wide&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to disable any default system-wide helper is to run the following command&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; config&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --system --unset&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; credential.helper
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-your-credentials-on-an-individual-repository-basis&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#setting-your-credentials-on-an-individual-repository-basis&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: setting-your-credentials-on-an-individual-repository-basis&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Setting your credentials on an individual repository basis&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you&#x27;ve disabled the system-wide helper, you can manage your credentials on a repository-basis. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;gitcredentials#_avoiding_repetition&quot;&gt;Git provides two built-in solutions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I chose to use the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; helper on my repos.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your repository and run:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; config credential.helper store
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will then prompt you for your remote credentials. Now try running a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and marvel at not having to be bothered by a pop-up!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-you-using-windows&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-are-you-using-windows&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-are-you-using-windows&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why are you using Windows?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never claimed to make wise decisions. But yes, this issue is nonexistent on my Ubuntu-based laptop, and probably on your Macbook Pro too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <id>https://kevinfiol.com/blog/making-your-numeric-keypad-work-on-a-xubuntu-2004-vm-virtualbox/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/making-your-numeric-keypad-work-on-a-xubuntu-2004-vm-virtualbox/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;making-your-numeric-keypad-work-on-a-xubuntu-20-04-vm-virtualbox&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#making-your-numeric-keypad-work-on-a-xubuntu-20-04-vm-virtualbox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: making-your-numeric-keypad-work-on-a-xubuntu-20-04-vm-virtualbox&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Making your numeric keypad work on a Xubuntu 20.04 VM (VirtualBox)&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fought with this for a good 2 hours before I finally got it working. First step is to install &lt;code&gt;numlockx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, if it&#x27;s not already installed:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; apt update
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; apt install numlockx
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable your Num Lock in your VM:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;numlockx&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Xubuntu, go to your Whisker Menu (or whatever launcher&#x2F;menu you&#x27;re using) and navigate to &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Accessibility -&amp;gt; Mouse&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and disable &lt;code&gt;Use mouse emulation&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re on vanilla Ubuntu (GNOME), or a DE other than XFCE, you may be looking for a menu called &lt;code&gt;Universal Access&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, wherein you&#x27;ll want to disable a feature called &lt;code&gt;Control the pointer using the keypad&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to log out and back in to confirm this works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/hosting-your-invidious-instance-on-a-vps/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;hosting-your-invidious-instance-on-a-vps&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#hosting-your-invidious-instance-on-a-vps&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: hosting-your-invidious-instance-on-a-vps&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Hosting Your Invidious Instance on a VPS&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2022: This post is likely outdated. I recommend checking the official installation instructions found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iv-org&#x2F;invidious&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iv-org&#x2F;invidious&quot;&gt;Invidious&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an alternative front-end to YouTube with an emphasis on privacy and low system resource usage. It is wonderful free software that not only does away with the annoyances of Google&#x27;s bloated, ad-ridden video site, but also adds plenty of QoL features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I spent some time setting up my own instance of Invidious to share with friends. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown on what I did:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-pick-a-server&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-pick-a-server&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-pick-a-server&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1. Pick a server&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with the $5&#x2F;mo Nanode over at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s packing a grand total 1GB of RAM, a single CPU, and 25GB of storage. More than enough to run our instance, but not enough to actually compile the damn codebase (we&#x27;ll get to this in a bit).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-get-a-domain-or-not&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-get-a-domain-or-not&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-get-a-domain-or-not&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2. Get a domain (or not)&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a simple and short domain name for myself and my buddies to be able to use instead of typing an IP address in the address bar every time. Getting a domain isn&#x27;t terribly important especially if you&#x27;re hosting this just for your own use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I used Namecheap to purchase my domain. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200803032836&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;merelycurious.me&#x2F;post&#x2F;connecting-namecheap-domain-to-linode&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; particularly helpful in setting up my domain with my Linode VPS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-pick-a-linux-distribution-for-your-vps&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#3-pick-a-linux-distribution-for-your-vps&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 3-pick-a-linux-distribution-for-your-vps&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;3. Pick a Linux Distribution for your VPS&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not terribly important what you pick. If you plan to use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tmiland&#x2F;Invidious-Updater&quot;&gt;Invidious Updater&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, know that it only supports Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Arch. Originally I attempted to use it on an Alpine Linux installation, but the script promptly failed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the Invidious docs only provide installation instructions for Arch Linux and Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu. I went with &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-pick-how-you-re-going-to-install-invidious&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#4-pick-how-you-re-going-to-install-invidious&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 4-pick-how-you-re-going-to-install-invidious&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;4. Pick how you&#x27;re going to install Invidious&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iv-org&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.md&quot;&gt;README&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides 3 options:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Invidious manually&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Invidious Updater (linked above)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Docker&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All options are simple and easy to do. I went with &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-install-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#5-install-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 5-install-it&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;5. Install it!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install dependencies:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pacman&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; -Syu&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; base-devel shards crystal librsvg postgresql nano
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;

&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;useradd -m&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; invidious

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only able to run the following commands as root. Make sure the postgresql service is running:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;psql&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; invidious kemal &amp;lt; &#x2F;home&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;config&#x2F;sql&#x2F;channels.sql

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps to install Invidious involve compiling the project code. On my measly 1GB of RAM, the compilation choked. In order to prepare for this, I used &lt;code&gt;systemd-swap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to create a swapfile. There are other ways to create a swapfile or a swap partition on Linux. See: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Swap&quot;&gt;Swap on Arch Linux Wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I found using &lt;code&gt;systemd-swap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; the simplest. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200803033711&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ricostacruz.com&#x2F;til&#x2F;after-installing-arch-linux&quot;&gt;This guide by Ricosta Cruz&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was very helpful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pacman&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; -Syu&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemd-swap
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I edited the config file to enable &lt;code&gt;zram_enabled=1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;swapfc_enabled=1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; nano &#x2F;etc&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;swap.conf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then enable &lt;code&gt;systemd-swap.service&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemctl enable&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --now&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemd-swap
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally add the swapfile to &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; so it&#x27;ll be used on every boot. Add this: &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;swapfile none swap defaults 0 0&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to the end of the file:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; nano &#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you won&#x27;t run out of RAM to setup Invidious. Let&#x27;s go back and finally install it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo -i -u&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; invidious
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; invidious
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;shards&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;shards&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; install
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;crystal&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; build src&#x2F;invidious.cr&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --release
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;.&#x2F;invidious &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# test compiled binary, stop with ctrl c
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;exit
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s installed! Now some administrative stuff. Let&#x27;s setup the systemd service so that Invidious runs in the background:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cp &#x2F;home&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;invidious.service &#x2F;etc&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;system&#x2F;invidious.service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemctl enable invidious.service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemctl start invidious.service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lets rotate the logs so that they don&#x27;t balloon in size:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; echo &amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;home&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;invidious.log {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;rotate 4
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;weekly
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;notifempty
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;missingok
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;compress
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;minsize 1048576
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a3be8c;&quot;&gt;}&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;quot; | &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;tee&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;logrotate.d&#x2F;invidious.logrotate
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; chmod 0644 &#x2F;etc&#x2F;logrotate.d&#x2F;invidious.logrotate
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now got a running Invidious instance! Navigate to your VPS&#x27;s IP address on port 3000 to see it up and running. Type &lt;code&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;&amp;lt;VPS_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;:3000&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; into your browser&#x27;s address bar, and get to watching some videos!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bought my domain, I intended to use it for more than just Invidious. In my case, I wanted a subdomain to serve as my Invidious URL, while I can use the main domain to host a &quot;hub&quot; of sorts to other services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tube.mydomain.com&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; -&amp;gt; Invidious Service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mydomain.com&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; -&amp;gt; Homepage
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to do this easily using nginx reverse proxies. Here are the steps I took.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install nginx:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; nginx-mainline
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable and start nginx service:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemctl enable nginx.service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; systemctl start nginx.service
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;nginx&#x2F;nginx.conf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Add this additional &lt;code&gt;server&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; entry somewhere under &lt;code&gt;http&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;http &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ...
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  server {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    server_name tube.mydomain.com;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    location &#x2F; {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      proxy_pass http:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1:3000;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ...
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next addition is completely optional if you want your root domain to point to a kind of homepage. This is what I wanted, so I&#x27;m putting it here partly to document it for myself. I changed the existing, default &lt;code&gt;http.server&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; entry to point to custom &lt;code&gt;html&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; I had written:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;http &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  server {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    server_name mydomain.com
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    location &#x2F; {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      root &#x2F;sites&#x2F;mydomain.com
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;      index index.html index.htm
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ... &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# the rest remained unchanged from the default
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ...
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-optional-enabling-https&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#7-optional-enabling-https&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 7-optional-enabling-https&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;7. (Optional) Enabling HTTPS&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certbot.eff.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;EFF&#x27;s Certbot for this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It is painfully easy to use. Note that if you choose to, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; make modifications to your &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must enable an option in Invidious&#x27;s config if you want assets to only be transferred via HTTPS. More information can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iv-org&#x2F;invidious&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Configuration&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all. Hopefully you found this helpful. If you got any questions, shoot me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:me@kevinfiol.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And always, if you liked this post, hit Like and Subscribe! (haha).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, happy birthday to my big bro! He&#x27;s 29 today. Wishing him good fortune, good health, good food, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On topic: I had been using Github Pages as my homepage solution for years now. Six years to be exact, which means since I was a senior finishing my undergrad. One of the reasons I began using it was that it was one of the only (if not, most popular) freely available static-site hosting solutions, and incredibly developer friendly. The same cannot be said in the year 2020.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: As of May 2021, I am back to Github Pages, being deployed via Github Actions. My reasoning for switching back was some inherent latency I discovered while using pages deployed on Netlify. Github Pages is snappier, in my experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/simple-state-management-in-mithriljs/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;simple-state-management-in-mithril-js&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#simple-state-management-in-mithril-js&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: simple-state-management-in-mithril-js&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Simple State Management in Mithril.js&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mithril.js.org&quot;&gt;Mithril.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a lightweight JavaScript framework that has become a staple in my development stack after I discovered it two years ago. At the time, I was looking for a simpler, zero-dependency alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;React.js&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that could help me learn modern JavaScript UI development without needing to simultaneously learn and understand various build tools and framework plugins.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve since learned React and have come to appreciate it for its influence on modern web development. However, I find that Mithril, a framework that sits at half the size of React whilst containing more features, has remained my go-to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-simple-variables&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#using-simple-variables&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: using-simple-variables&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Using simple variables&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to state management, Mithril is as unopinionated as they come. You can use Redux, Mobx, Cerebral, some implementation of the SAM pattern, or best of all -- just a plain ol&#x27; JavaScript object! Mithril comes with a global, auto-redraw system. The virtual DOM created by Mithril will diff against and synchronize the DOM whenever changes are made to your data layer. Most commonly, the redraws are triggered after an event handler defined in your Mithril application is called. But you can also manually trigger a DOM update with &lt;code&gt;m.redraw&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in practice is that you are free to structure your data however you&#x27;d like, and Mithril takes care of the rest. Below is an example of a simple Counter application written with Mithril:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;let &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;count &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Counter &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;view&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: () &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our state is just a single primitive variable! For small applications, simple widgets or one-off UI components, the above solution is largely sufficient. What&#x27;s important about implementing your state management solution is to understand that there is no silver bullet. You will be able to predict your needs more accurately as you work across multiple projects and grow organically. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a brilliant solution for modern UI state management, but the 9&#x2F;10 times I have attempted to use it out of a desire to do things &quot;the right way&quot;, it was absolute overkill. I advise reading &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@dan_abramov&#x2F;you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above solution is simple and likely sufficient for small use-cases, it introduces one problem - we are modifying the state directly from within the view. It won&#x27;t take long before this approach proves unwieldy, and you&#x27;re scanning your templates trying to find where you wrote the logic that is altering your state in (potentially) unpredictable ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can introduce indirection and a more versatile state container using plain JavaScript objects. Our &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; component becomes more terse, yet more expressive:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= { count: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0 &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;};

&lt;p&gt;As your application grows in size, it might be preferable that your state and actions are easily testable and replicable from the beginning. Further, instead of relying on lexical scoping for your actions to have access to your state, we can use a combination of dependency injection and closures so that an instance of your actions will always directly reference a specific state object. We can easily achieve this with factory functions that provide your initial state and actions that directly reference a single state object.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;State &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= () &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({ count: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0 &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;});
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;Actions &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;({
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;increment&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: () &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;count &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;+= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;decrement&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: () &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;count &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;});
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, it is dead simple to reproduce your state and actions objects respectively:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state   &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;State&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;actions &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;Actions&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing these to a Mithril component is trivial using the &lt;code&gt;attrs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; property (near-equivalent to &lt;code&gt;props&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in React) and object destructuring. Notice that our Counter component remains virtually unchanged:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;js&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-js &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;const &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Counter &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= {

&lt;p&gt;(P.S. Credit goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;porsager&quot;&gt;porsager&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who shared this brilliant solution in the Mithril.js Gitter, nicknamed &quot;Mitosis&quot;, named after the equally awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;meiosis.js.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Meiosis Pattern by foxdonut&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;This is my preferred approach to state management in Mithril.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Passing your state and actions to child components would work as you&#x27;d expect. Simply pass your state and actions objects further down as &lt;code&gt;attrs&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, or more wisely, be selective of what you choose to expose to child components.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also take an approach where your application is composed of solely stateless components. That is, every component is a pure, deterministic function. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JorgeBucaran&#x2F;hyperapp&quot;&gt;Hyperapp&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a JavaScript framework that does not allow for local state in components. Instead, every component returns a portion of your UI that reflects the global state. While I highly recommend checking out Hyperapp (it&#x27;s only 1kb gzipped!), this post is about Mithril, and you can use a similar approach with Mithril.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/brew-candy-review/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;brew-candy-review&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#brew-candy-review&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: brew-candy-review&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Brew Candy Review&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my birthday, a very dear friend of mine sent me these Brew Candies. She had requested that I let her know how they are, so I resolved to put together a brief review and summary of my experience eating these beer-inspired candies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy bag&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love beer. And maybe because of this, I was very skeptical of these candies. Can you truly replicate the nuances of flavor found in beers such as IPAs and stouts? Perhaps if you jampack your candy with an overbearing bitterness reminiscent of hops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy bag with three pieces of candy&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package includes three flavors:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hoppy IPA&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey Ale&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasty Stout&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a stout-lover, I chose to leave what I presumed to be the best for last.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy back of bag&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious (or not) enough, these candies contain no alcohol! Which makes it safe for you to distribute to your underage cousins without legal repercussions. Anyway here are my thoughts on these beer treats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hoppy-ipa&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#hoppy-ipa&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: hoppy-ipa&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Hoppy IPA&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy hoppy ipa flavor&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s instantly recognizable from these candies is that they seem to resemble, albeit crudely, the shape of a hop. Or at least... I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a hop. Either way, it&#x27;s an admirable feature, and the texture at least adds to the novelty of the packaging.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the taste test!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hoppy IPA variant is mildly sweet, but with a sharp hoppy flavor that lingers on the tongue. As you&#x27;d imagine, it has a strong bittery aftertaste. Does not taste like a beer per say, but it is recognizable instantly. A taste not too different from other hard candies, surprisingly. Can easily disguise this among other kid-oriented candies. An interesting flavor, but not particularly great. Overall a &lt;strong&gt;6&#x2F;10&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;honey-ale&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#honey-ale&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: honey-ale&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Honey Ale&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy honey ale flavor&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has the bitterness of a hoppy beer, but distinctively honey flavor that is not overshadowed by the hoppiness. You may be able to hide this among other honey flavored candies and get away with it. Might be a great gateway drug to trick people into liking IPAs even! A subtle sweetness, and none of the biting aftertaste found in the Hoppy IPA flavor. May be one of my more favorite honey-flavored candies I have tried. I give it a &lt;strong&gt;8&#x2F;10&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;roasty-stout&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#roasty-stout&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: roasty-stout&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Roasty Stout&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;brew_candy&amp;#x2F;6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brew candy roasty stout flavor&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love stouts, porters, and any kind of coffee-flavored dark beers, so this flavor was right up my alley. This near-perfectly replicates the flavor of a coffee stout in candy form. Easily my favorite of the three flavors, so much that I&#x27;ve probably already eaten most of these from the bag. If you&#x27;re trying to convince someone who already likes coffee caramels (or similar candies) to try some dark beers, this might be a good stepping stone. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if Brew Candy made bags full of this stuff. More please. &lt;strong&gt;9&#x2F;10&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a fun taste test. I&#x27;ve never written reviews for food items (or much anything really), so excuse me if you think this review sucks. I want to give a big thanks to my very thoughtful friend who gave me the opportunity to try these, and I look forward to finishing the rest of the bag.

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have commit rights to the upstream repo, you can create a local &lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch and do work that will go to upstream there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful with this, because if you ignore a file, and then do a &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; after the file was changed upstream, you&#x27;ll get a conflict. And you&#x27;ll be confused because Git will tell you to stash your changes, all the while &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is showing no changes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; update-index&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --assume-unchanged &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unignore it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; update-index&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --no-assume-unchanged &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;file&amp;gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://kevinfiol.com/blog/bullet-pools-with-timers-in-haxeflixel/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;bullet-pools-with-timers-in-haxeflixel&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bullet-pools-with-timers-in-haxeflixel&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bullet-pools-with-timers-in-haxeflixel&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bullet Pools with Timers in HaxeFlixel&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more useful features of the flixel library is the inclusion of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.haxeflixel.com&#x2F;flixel&#x2F;group&#x2F;FlxTypedGroup.html&quot;&gt;FlxTypedGroup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class, which makes it easier to organize, update, and render multiple instances of an FlxBasic object. A few getter methods provide useful information such as the length of the group, or an array of every member in an instantiated group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical application of FlxTypedGroup can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HaxeFlixel&#x2F;flixel-demos&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Arcade&#x2F;FlxTeroids&#x2F;source&quot;&gt;&#x27;Asteroids&#x27; demo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; available via the HaxeFlixel repository. FlxTypedGroup&#x27;s &lt;code&gt;recycle&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method allows us to resuse bullet objects without having to destroy, recreate, and reallocate memory each time. Instead, bullets can be respawned from the queue after the pool has been &quot;expended.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In the demo example available in the HaxeFlixel repository, the properties of each bullet are initialized on the fly within &lt;code&gt;PlayState.hx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. For my example, I have created a separate &lt;code&gt;Bullet&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class for the sake of convenience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current PlayState, we can create and initialize a pool called &lt;code&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which we will populate with bullet objects from which we can spawn bullets as we please. In this case, I will create a pool with a maximum size of 3.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-haxe &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-haxe&quot; data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;class &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;PlayState &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;extends &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxState
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;public static var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxTypedGroup&amp;lt;Bullet&amp;gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;override public function &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;create&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;():&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Void
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;poolSize&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Int &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;Bullet;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= new &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxTypedGroup&amp;lt;Bullet&amp;gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;poolSize&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we can write a simple loop to create new bullet objects and simply add them to the existing group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;poolSize&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Int &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:Bullet;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= new FlxTypedGroup&amp;lt;Bullet&amp;gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;poolSize&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;for &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;i &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;in &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;poolSize&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= new Bullet();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;add&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within our Player class, we can then just reference the main PlayState&#x27;s &lt;code&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; pool to recycle &lt;code&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; objects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-haxe &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-haxe&quot; data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (FlxG.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;keys&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;justPressed&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:Bullet = PlayState.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;recycle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F; YOUR BULLET VELOCITY CODE GOES HERE
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we just add our standard logic that handles bullet velocity, acceleration, or how, when, and where your Sprite class may spawn bullet objects. As seen in the example below, only 3 bullets may be on the screen at one time, with the earliest spawned bullet being replaced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;&amp;#x2F;img&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;haxeflixel-bullet-timers&amp;#x2F;1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;asteroids animation&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the example of the original Asteroids arcade game, we can give each bullet a limited lifetime, meaning if the bullet does not collide with another asteroid or enemy sprite, it should cease to exist after a certain period of time. Otherwise, it would continue travelling endlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to do this using HaxeFlixel&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.haxeflixel.com&#x2F;flixel&#x2F;util&#x2F;FlxTimer.html&quot;&gt;FlxTimer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class, however, you may also use the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.haxe.org&#x2F;haxe&#x2F;Timer.html&quot;&gt;Timer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; class included in the Haxe Toolkit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within my &lt;code&gt;Bullet.hx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class, I declare &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and initialize it as an FlxTimer object in the class constructor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-haxe &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-haxe&quot; data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;class &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Bullet &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;extends &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxSprite
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;public var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;timer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxTimer;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;public function new&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Float &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Float &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) 
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;super&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Y&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;timer &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= new &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;FlxTimer();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;YOUR OBJECT PROPERTIES GO HERE
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;override public function &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;update&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;elapsed&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Float&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;):&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Void
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	{
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;...
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;	}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#eff1f5;&quot;&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating a new FlxTimer object each time a bullet is recycled, the existing one is simply reset when needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back in the &lt;code&gt;Player.hx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; class, we simply set and start the FlxTimer object for each bullet as they fire. The &lt;code&gt;start&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; method of an FlxTimer object &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.haxeflixel.com&#x2F;flixel&#x2F;util&#x2F;FlxTimer.html#start&quot;&gt;takes three arguments&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-haxe &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-haxe&quot; data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;start&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Time:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Float &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ?OnComplete:FlxTimer‑&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Void&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Loops:&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ebcb8b;&quot;&gt;Int &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;):FlxTimer
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:Float&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; How many seconds it takes for the timer to go off. If 0 then timer will fire OnComplete callback only once at the first call of update method (which means that Loops argument will be ignored).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnComplete:FlxTimer-&amp;gt;Void&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Optional, triggered whenever the time runs out, once for each loop. Callback should be formed &quot;onTimer(Timer:FlxTimer);&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loops:Int&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; How many times the timer should go off. 0 means &quot;looping forever&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example below, I pass &lt;code&gt;2.0&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Time&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, an anonymous function for &lt;code&gt;OnComplete&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that switches the bullets &lt;code&gt;exists&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Loops&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; so that the function only triggers once.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-haxe &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-haxe&quot; data-lang=&quot;haxe&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;if&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (FlxG.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;keys&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;justPressed&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;var &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:Bullet = PlayState.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullets&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;recycle&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;();
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;timer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8fa1b3;&quot;&gt;start&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;2.0&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b48ead;&quot;&gt;function &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;Timer&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:FlxTimer) {
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;			&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;bullet&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;exists &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;= &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;false&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		},
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;		&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d08770;&quot;&gt;1
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;	);
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, not only do you limit the amount of bullets that can be on the screen at once, but you can limit the duration for said bullets! It&#x27;s a very neat and useful mechanic for balancing your game that can be applied to any pool of FlxBasic objects you may need, whether it be enemies, ammunition, or environmental objects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
